# Ionic 2 Side Menu + Tabs

UPDATED: This branch, at the time of pushing, was using these dependencies:
```
  "dependencies": {
    "@angular/common": "2.0.0-rc.4",
    .....

    "ionic-angular": "2.0.0-beta.11",
    "ionic-native": "1.3.10",
    ....
  },
```

Since Angular 2 (and Ionic 2) has gone full-retard with Typescript, this branch is of Typescript entirely. For the example involving vanilla Javascript, see the master branch.
